Answer the question why JavaScript needs the parentheses in this case?

JavaScript has operators precedence. () has higher precedence than multiplication and division. 
In this case inorder to calculta area, we need to multiply (base and height) first and then 
divide the answer with 2. We use paranthesis around (base*height) so that they can be calculated first.
Multiplication and division has same precedence. Even if we dont put paranthesis and write base*height/2, 
javascript performs calculations on multiplication and division left to right, this should not effect the result.
